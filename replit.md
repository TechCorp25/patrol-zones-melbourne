# Patrol Zones — Melbourne CBD

## Non-Negotiable Code Quality Standards

These requirements apply to **all** code changes in this project without exception — new files, updates, improvements, refactors, and bug fixes alike.

1. **Best in class quality** — code must be well-structured, readable, and maintainable. No shortcuts, no dead code, no commented-out blocks left behind.
2. **Modern industry best practices** — follow current TypeScript, React Native, and Node.js conventions. Use appropriate patterns (hooks, memoisation, optimistic updates, etc.) where they apply.
3. **No breaking changes** — every change must retain all existing features and functionality. Regressions are not acceptable.
4. **Production ready** — all code must be TypeScript-clean (zero `tsc --noEmit` errors), free of runtime exceptions, resilient to edge cases, and tested before delivery.

## Project Overview
A mobile-first React Native (Expo) app for Melbourne City Council patrol officers. Provides real-time GPS location on a Melbourne CBD patrol zone map, a live magnetic compass, and daily zone assignment management.

## Architecture

### Frontend (Expo + React Native)
- **Framework**: Expo SDK 54, Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Maps**: react-native-maps@1.20.1 (pinned exact version — required for Expo Go iOS compatibility)
- **Location**: expo-location (GPS + heading watchdog)
- **Fonts**: @expo-google-fonts/roboto-mono
- **Animation**: react-native-reanimated@4.1.x + react-native-worklets (New Architecture, requires `newArchEnabled: true`)
- **Storage**: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- **Icons**: @expo/vector-icons (Ionicons, MaterialCommunityIcons)

### Backend (Express + TypeScript)
- Serves landing page and Expo manifest
- Port 5000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM (`server/db.ts` + `server/storage.ts` — `DbStorage`)
- **Tables**: `users`, `code21_requests`, `sessions` (schema in `shared/schema.ts`, managed by Drizzle)
- **API**: `POST /api/code21`, `GET /api/code21?officerNumber=...` — persistent storage

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/index.tsx` | Main map screen — GPS, zones, compass, panel, zone info modal |
| `app/_layout.tsx` | Root layout with fonts, providers |
| `constants/zones.ts` | All 15 patrol zone polygon definitions + patrol streets + boundaries + heading labels |
| `constants/streets.ts` | Melbourne CBD street geometry — 18 streets defined as polylines through real OSM intersection coordinates; `getCurrentStreetPosition()` finds closest segment across all streets |
| `constants/streetNumbers.ts` | Authoritative street number block ranges (543 markers) from City of Melbourne data; `getStreetNumberMarkers()` generates positioned map markers |
| `constants/parkingZones.ts` | Parking zone lookup — 711 zones across 491 street segments (Batch 1-7 merged); `getParkingZones(street, from, to)` returns matching zone numbers |
| `constants/colors.ts` | Dark navy theme colors |
| `components/Compass.tsx` | Animated magnetic compass widget |
| `components/PatrolMap.tsx` | Native map with zone polygons (react-native-maps) |
| `components/PatrolMap.web.tsx` | Web stub (native maps not supported) |
| `components/ZoneInfoModal.tsx` | Modal overlay showing zone boundaries + patrol streets |

## Patrol Zones (15 total)

All zones use proper 4-point polygon coordinates derived from OpenStreetMap intersection data, matching Melbourne's ~30° rotated Hoddle Grid. Each zone is a quadrilateral with corners at actual street intersection coordinates (not axis-aligned rectangles):

| Zone | Boundaries |
|------|-----------|
| FLAGSTAFF | Spencer–William, Lonsdale–La Trobe |
| SPENCER | Spencer–William, Little Bourke–Collins |
| RIALTO | Spencer–William, Collins–Flinders |
| SUPREME | William–Queen, La Trobe–Lonsdale |
| TAVISTOCK | William–Queen, Lonsdale–Collins |
| TITLES | Queen–Elizabeth, La Trobe–Lonsdale |
| HARDWARE | Queen–Elizabeth, Lonsdale–Collins |
| BANKS | Queen–Elizabeth, Little Collins–Flinders |
| THE MAC | Elizabeth–Swanston, Franklin–La Trobe |
| LIBRARY | Elizabeth–Russell, La Trobe–Little Bourke |
| CHINA TOWN | Elizabeth–Russell, Little Bourke–Collins |
| CITY SQUARE | Elizabeth–Russell, Collins–Flinders |
| PRINCESS | Russell–Spring, Victoria–Bourke |
| HYATT | Russell–Exhibition, Bourke–Flinders |
| TWIN TOWERS | Exhibition–Spring, Bourke–Flinders |

## Features
- Live GPS position (updates every 2s / 3m distance)
- Real-time zone detection (point-in-polygon ray casting)
- Magnetic compass with Melbourne CBD street labels (La Trobe=N, Spring=E, Flinders=S, Spencer=W) — 4 cardinal directions only, no sub-directional points
- Map type toggle (iOS: Dark/Light/Satellite/Hybrid; Android: Standard/Satellite/Hybrid) with dark/light style switching
- Zone assignment (persisted via AsyncStorage)
- Zone info modal showing patrol streets, laneways, and boundary details
- Out-of-zone warnings
- Coordinate display with accuracy indicator
- Current street position display showing nearest street name, which block (between cross-streets), and which side (East/West for N-S streets, North/South for E-W streets) — uses perpendicular projection onto 17 Melbourne CBD street centerlines with 35m max detection radius
- Compass heading with Melbourne CBD grid-relative direction labels (Toward La Trobe/Spring/Flinders/Spencer)
- Parking zone numbers displayed for the current street segment (711 zones across 491 segments, amber-colored "P" prefix)
- Collapsible bottom panel — minimize button (chevron-down) hides the panel entirely to maximize map view; pull-tab with swipe-up gesture or tap restores it. Overlay buttons (map type, zone info, locate) animate position smoothly with panel state

## Zone Audit (Completed)
All 15 patrol zone `patrolStreets` definitions have been audited and corrected against Melbourne CBD geography and parking zone data. Key fixes applied:
- **SUPREME**: A'Beckett split at Wills Street (added William→Wills segment); La Trobe split at Wills; LL/Lonsdale corrected from "Elizabeth→Queen" to "Queen→William"; Queen A'Beckett→Franklin moved to TITLES; William Street added
- **TITLES**: A'Beckett split at Anthony Street; Franklin split at Anthony; Queen A'Beckett→Franklin added (from SUPREME); Little Lonsdale and Lonsdale segments added (Queen→Elizabeth)
- **TAVISTOCK**: All main streets corrected from "Elizabeth→Queen" to "Queen→William"; Elizabeth Street removed (belongs to CHINA TOWN); Collins added with Market Street split; Lonsdale added; William Street segments added; Market Street added
- **CHINA TOWN**: Elizabeth expanded from 1 to 3 segments (LB→Bourke, Bourke→LC, LC→Collins)
- **SPENCER**: Bourke, Little Collins, Little Bourke expanded with King→Spencer segments; Spencer Street added (3 segments); Godfrey Street added; King Collins→LC added
- **RIALTO**: Moved above-Collins streets (Bourke, LC, Spencer LC-Bourke, Godfrey) to SPENCER; added Flinders Lane, Flinders Street, King, William segments within Collins-Flinders territory
- **HARDWARE**: Lonsdale added (Queen→Elizabeth); Queen Lonsdale→LB added
- **HYATT**: Russell expanded from 1 to 3 segments (Flinders→FLane, FLane→Collins, Collins→LC); Exhibition removed (belongs to TWIN TOWERS)
- **TWIN TOWERS**: Exhibition Street added (4 segments: Flinders→FLane, FLane→Collins, Collins→LC, LC→Bourke)
- **CITY SQUARE**: Russell removed (boundary not included); W boundary label corrected from "Swanston" to "Elizabeth"

## Address Data (Corrected)
All 18 street address arrays have been corrected to match actual Melbourne CBD numbering, verified against real landmark addresses:
- **N-S streets** (Flinders=2, increasing northward): Swanston 100@Collins (Town Hall), 37@FLane (Nicholson Bldg), 328@StateLib; Elizabeth 82@Collins, 115@LCollins, 361@LaTrobe; Queen 100@Collins (ANZ Gothic Bank); William 100@LCollins (Australian Club); Russell 180@LBourke (Total House); Exhibition 186@LBourke
- **E-W streets** (Spring=2, increasing westward): Collins 394@Queen, 459@William, 555@King; Bourke 90@Exhibition, 250@Swanston, 350@Elizabeth (GPO); Lonsdale 300@Swanston (Melbourne Central)
- Address markers styled as Google Maps grey text (no badge), 22m offset from street centre with 8m perpendicular nudge to separate N-S and E-W markers at intersections; dark/light variants adapt to map type

## Granular Street Number Markers (Integrated)
- `constants/streetNumbers.ts` — 886 representative street numbers selected from 7k+ addresses (City of Melbourne Open Data), ~3-4 per block per side spaced ~30 numbers apart
- `selectRepresentativeNumbers()` picks first, last, and evenly-spaced intermediate numbers from each block side (max 5 per side)
- All 886 markers pre-computed at module level and rendered as a stable set (no viewport churn) to prevent iOS crashes
- Two-tier zoom: zone polygons at `latitudeDelta < 0.012`, street numbers at `latitudeDelta < 0.004` (simple boolean toggle)
- High-contrast text: white (#FFFFFF) bold with dark shadow on dark maps, dark (#1A1A2E) bold with light shadow on light maps; 13px bold
- `tracksViewChanges={false}` for all markers — static bitmaps, no per-frame re-rendering
- Data sourced from `scripts/out/melbourne_cbd_street_blocks.json`

## Street Block Data Generation
The `scripts/generate_melbourne_cbd_street_blocks.py` script fetches authoritative data from City of Melbourne Open Data:
- **Road Segments** (`road-segment` dataset): Polygon corridors with `streetname`, `streetfrom`, `streetto` — converted to centerlines via polygon edge midpoint extraction for side-of-street inference
- **Street Addresses** (`street-addresses` dataset): Streamed via `/exports/jsonl` endpoint with `in_bbox()` spatial filter to avoid 10k offset cap
- Outputs: `scripts/out/melbourne_cbd_street_blocks.json` — 198 streets, ~14k street numbers, organized by block (between-streets) and side (north/south or east/west)
- Run: `python scripts/generate_melbourne_cbd_street_blocks.py --outdir scripts/out --single`
- Dependencies: requests, shapely, rtree, pyproj, tqdm, orjson (+ libspatialindex system dep)

## Code 21 Modal — Two-Tab Workflow

The Code 21 modal has two tabs navigated via horizontal swipe or tab bar tap:

- **NEW REQUEST / EDIT REQUEST (Tab 0)**: Full form for initiating a physical attendance — address search, offence type, vehicle details, dispatch/attendance notes, PIN, travel mode. Save adds an optimistic map marker immediately; server persists in background.
- **IN PROGRESS (Tab 1)**: Live list of all active Code 21 requests. Each item shows address, offence type, and date/time with two actions:
  - **Edit** (pencil icon): Loads the request into Tab 0 for amendment without creating a duplicate
  - **Mark Complete** (tick icon): Optimistically removes the item from the list and PATCHes `status = "complete"` to the server

### Status Lifecycle
- New requests default to `status: "in_progress"`
- Completed requests are removed from Tab 1 and the route optimiser, but their map markers remain for the session
- `PATCH /api/code21/:id` endpoint updates status in the database
- `status` column added to `code21_requests` table (DB migration applied)

## Optimisation History

### Repo-Wide Assessment (2026-03-08)
Applied a full-scale evidence-based assessment and optimisation pass. All changes verified via `tsc --noEmit` (zero errors), `expo lint` (zero warnings), and smoke test.

**Correctness / Reliability**
- `server/routes.ts` — Rate limiter `attempts` Map now purges stale entries when size exceeds 5 000, preventing unbounded memory growth in long-running processes
- `server/routes.ts` — `POST /api/elevation` now validates input with Zod (was an unsafe cast with no type or bounds checking); also validates the external API response shape before mapping
- `server/routes.ts` — Elevation endpoint now guards against malformed upstream responses returning wrong result count

**Performance / Battery**
- `components/PatrolMap.tsx` — User location marker now has `tracksViewChanges={false}`, preventing a native bitmap snapshot cycle every 150 ms heading update (was always implicitly `true` — iOS/Android re-rendered on every compass tick)
- `app/index.tsx` — `destinations` prop memoized via `useMemo`; was recreating a new array on every render, defeating `memo(PatrolMap)` and causing unnecessary re-renders
- `app/index.tsx` — `onDestinationPress` and `onDestinationLongPress` converted from inline JSX lambdas to `useCallback` hooks; was creating new function references on every render, defeating `memo(PatrolMap)`
- `app/index.tsx` — `MAP_TYPES`, `MAP_TYPE_LABELS`, `MAP_TYPE_ICONS` lifted to module scope; `Platform.OS` is stable at runtime, no need to re-evaluate on every render
- `app/index.tsx` — `visibleCode21Requests` memo now consumes `inProgressRequests` directly instead of re-filtering `code21Requests` a second time

**Dead Code Removed**
- `lib/query-client.ts` — Removed `getApiUrl`, `apiRequest`, `getQueryFn` exports — none were called anywhere in the codebase; `queryClient` is the only used export
- `components/KeyboardAwareScrollViewCompat.tsx` — Removed; the component was never imported or used
- `app/_layout.tsx` — Removed redundant `RootLayoutNav` inner component; the `Stack` is now inlined directly, eliminating an extra function allocation per mount
- `app/index.tsx` — Removed empty `onMapReady={() => {}}` no-op prop; was creating a new function reference on every render for no effect

**Production-Readiness Pass (2026-03-08)**
Applied five targeted hardening changes. All verified via `tsc --noEmit` (zero errors), `expo lint` (zero warnings), and end-to-end smoke test.

- `server/index.ts` — Added `app.set("trust proxy", 1)` so `req.ip` resolves the real client IP behind Replit's reverse proxy; without this the rate limiter keyed all requests to the same proxy IP
- `server/index.ts` — Fixed Metro dev proxy catching all `/api/*` paths before Express route handlers; added an explicit guard so API requests reach their handlers
- `shared/schema.ts`, `server/storage.ts` — Sessions now persisted to a `sessions` DB table (token, userId, createdAt, expiresAt); 30-day TTL; expired sessions are lazily deleted on read; a scheduled purge fires on startup and every 6 hours
- `constants/offenceTypes.ts` (new) — `CODE21_TYPES as const` extracted to a dependency-free file; `shared/schema.ts` and `constants/code21.ts` both import from it, eliminating the duplicate enum list
- `constants/intersections.ts` (new) — Shared Melbourne CBD intersection coordinates extracted from `streets.ts` and `streetNumbers.ts`; both files now import the single source, eliminating ~200 lines of duplicated coordinate data

**Bug Fix Pass (2026-03-08) — Multi-stop routing crash + stale location**
Three targeted fixes in `app/index.tsx`. All verified via `tsc --noEmit` (zero errors), `expo lint` (zero warnings), and end-to-end smoke test.

- `animateToRegion` crash — the nav-target animation effect previously depended on both `activeNavRequest` and `location`, firing every 2 seconds on each GPS update during navigation and starting overlapping 700 ms animations, which caused a native crash in react-native-maps. Fixed by removing `location` from the dependency array and reading `locationRef.current` inside the effect so it only fires when the nav target actually changes.
- Stale-closure route location — the route-fetching `useEffect` called `fetchOptimisedRoute(..., location)` where `location` was a stale closure variable captured from the render that created the timeout. Fixed by reading `locationRef.current` inside the `setTimeout` callback so OSRM always receives the live position; `fetchOptimisedRoute` added to the effect's dependency array and the suppression comment removed.
- Unhandled optimisation rejection — `optimiseWithTerrainAndSLA` promise was chained with `.then()` only; added `.catch()` that falls back to the unoptimised request order so a transient elevation API failure can't silently crash the routing chain.
- `Linking.openURL` unhandled rejection — wrapped in `.catch()` to show an `Alert` if Google Maps cannot be opened on the device.

**Startup Crash Fix (2026-03-08) — React Compiler + Reanimated worklet ordering**
Fixed `Exception in HostFunction:<unknown>` crash that caused the app to crash immediately after the main screen rendered on iOS Expo Go.

Root cause: In Expo SDK 54, the React Compiler is built into `babel-preset-expo`. Without an explicit Babel plugin declaration, the Reanimated worklet transform was not guaranteed to run *after* the React Compiler. When the ordering was wrong, `useAnimatedStyle` and `runOnJS` worklets were not properly serialized — the first time the UI thread called into any worklet (the panel animated style fires the moment the map screen mounts), it threw `Exception in HostFunction:<unknown>` and crashed the app.

Fix: Added `react-native-reanimated/plugin` as an explicit `plugins` entry in `babel.config.js` so it is always applied last, after all preset transforms including the React Compiler. All package versions reverted to correct state: react-native-maps@1.20.1, react-native-reanimated@4.1.6, react-native-worklets@0.5.1, `newArchEnabled: true`.
